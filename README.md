# CanvaCo

CanvaCo is a nodejs application which uses websockets and express to collaboratively draw on an HTML canvas.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

All you'll need on your machine to run this program is Node.js. If you have not already installed it, you may click [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) and do so.


### Installing Dependencies

The dependencies for the project are already included in the repo (although doing this is a bad practice), so you will not need to install dependencies on your own. However, just to be sure, open a terminal/cmd window, navigate to the project folder, and run the following command:

```
npm install
```

The dependencies should now be updated.

## Running the site

To run the site, open a terminal/cmd window, navigate to the project folder, and run the following command:

```
node index.js
```

The console should tell you that the express server is running on port 8080 so you may open a web browser window and navigate to this location. In chrome, you simply have to type in:

```
localhost:8080
```
